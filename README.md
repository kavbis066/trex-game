## trex-game

This is an attempt at making chrome trex game using pure javascript, html and css. The box bounces by pressing space key as of now.

In this game I am using the concept of the chrome trex-game, hence I am using boxes for obstacles (orange box) and the main game object (red box) which has to save itself from colliding with the obstacles. Once the red box collides with any orange box the game will be over.

I have taken reference from a tutorial by [Ania Kubow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ6lYd6dyTI)

### Changes to be made:
- To add a proper background and objects as in chrome dino game
- Some of the similar functions on arrow up and down keys.
- Adding scores
