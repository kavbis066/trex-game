## trex-game

This is an attempt at making chrome trex game using pure javascript, html and css. The box bounces by pressing space key as of now.

I have taken reference from a tutorial by [Ania Kubow](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dQ6lYd6dyTI)

### Changes to be made:
- To add a proper background and objects as in chrome dino game
- Some of the similar functions on arrow up and down keys.
